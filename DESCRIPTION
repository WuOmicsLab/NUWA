Description: NUWA is a computational pipeline for robust abundance inference of missing function proteins (e.g., cell markers, drug targets) from mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiles, and could lead to improved performance of downstream analyses with proteomic profiles, including deconvolution of immune cell composition, differential expression analysis, etc. The performance of NUWA pipeline has been systematically evaluated by multiple approaches and validated by scRNA-seq data and drug sensitivity analysis using patient-derived organoids. A user-friendly web server is also available for convenient analysis at https://omics.bjcancer.org/nuwa, while source codes provided at GitHub for local analysis at large scale without number limit and more custom functions.
