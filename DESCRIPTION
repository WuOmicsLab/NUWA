Description: NUWA is a computational pipeline for robust abundance inference of missing cell type markers in proteomic profiles (by NUWA-ms) and deciphering makeup of immune cell subsets (by NUWA-eDeconv or other popular deconvolution algorithms), which could enable accurate proteomic deconvolution of tissue-infiltrating cell populations. The performance of NUWA pipeline has been systematically evaluated by multiple approaches with validation using scRNA-seq data, see the NUWA manuscript for more details.
